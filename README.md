# Phalcon Backend Service Deployment Guide with AWS Blue-Green Deployment

## Overview
This guide details the deployment process for the Phalcon backend service utilizing AWS Blue-Green deployment strategy. Phalcon serves as the backend for the application, handling PHP requests. AWS services such as ECS Fargate, CodePipeline, AWS App Mesh, AWS Cloud Map, ALB, and NLB are utilized for efficient deployment and orchestration.

### Technologies Used:
- AWS ECS Fargate
- AWS CodePipeline
- AWS App Mesh
- AWS Cloud Map
- AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- ALB (Application Load Balancer)
- NLB (Network Load Balancer)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Docker Configuration
- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Phalcon backend container setup.

### 2. Task Definition
- **taskdef.json**: Defines the ECS task configuration for the Phalcon backend.

### 3. Backend Logic
- **index.php**: Backend PHP logic handling requests and responses.

### 4. Deployment Strategy
#### Blue-Green Deployment
- Blue-Green deployment ensures zero-downtime deployment and rollback capabilities by creating a separate set of resources for the new version (Green) while keeping the old version (Blue) intact.

### 5. NLB Configuration
- **NLB**: Routes traffic to the Phalcon backend.

### 6. AWS App Mesh Integration
- **Proxy Configuration**: Manages traffic routing and service discovery between Nginx and Phalcon containers using AWS App Mesh.

## How It Works
1. **CodePipeline**: Initiates deployment upon code changes.
2. **Build & Test (CI)**: Code changes are built and tested.
3. **Blue-Green Deployment**:
   - **Blue Environment**: Existing stable environment.
   - **Green Environment**: New environment with updates.
4. **Traffic Routing**:
   - **ALB**: Routes traffic to the Nginx container.
   - **NLB**: Routes traffic to the Phalcon backend.
5. **AWS App Mesh**:
   - Facilitates seamless communication between Nginx and Phalcon containers.
   - Provides service discovery and routing capabilities.
6. **Rollback**:
   - If issues arise, rollback to the stable Blue environment is seamless.

## Conclusion
This deployment strategy ensures reliable and scalable deployment of the Phalcon backend service with minimal downtime and risk. By leveraging AWS services like ECS, CodePipeline, ALB, NLB, and AWS App Mesh, the deployment process is streamlined, offering flexibility and efficiency in managing containerized applications.
